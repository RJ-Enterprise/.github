## 🛢️ Oil Supply Management System – Project Overview

This project is designed to **digitize and simplify the oil supply business operations** of **RJ Enterprise**.
The goal of the system is to make oil ordering, payment handling, and delivery management **more organized, transparent, and efficient** for both customers and the business owner.

Traditionally, oil supply businesses rely on phone calls, manual registers, and informal payment tracking. This often leads to confusion in orders, delays in delivery, payment mismatches, and difficulty in managing discounts or bulk customers.
This system solves those problems by bringing everything onto **one centralized digital platform**.

## 👤 Customer Side (Buyer Experience)

Customers can easily view available oil products, select quantities as per their requirement, and place orders online without the need for repeated phone calls.

The system allows customers to:

* Browse different types of oil products
* Choose quantity based on household or business needs
* Apply available offers or discounts
* Place orders with clear pricing
* Choose simple payment options like cash on delivery or direct UPI payment
* Track the status of their order until delivery
* View past orders and invoices for reference

This improves customer trust, saves time, and provides a smooth buying experience.

## 🧑‍💼 Admin Side (Business Owner Control)

The business owner (RJ Enterprise) gets a dedicated management panel to control the entire operation from one place.

The system allows the admin to:

* Manage oil products, pricing, and availability
* View all incoming orders with customer details
* Approve or reject orders based on stock availability
* Verify payments made by customers
* Manage delivery status for each order
* Create and control discount offers and coupons
* Monitor sales and order history

This reduces manual work and gives the business complete visibility over daily operations.

## 💰 Payment & Offer Handling

Instead of depending on third-party payment gateways, the system supports **simple and controlled payment handling**.
Customers can make payments directly, and the admin verifies them before confirming orders.

The business can also run **custom offers**, such as:

* Discounts on bulk orders
* Special pricing for loyal customers
* Festival or seasonal offers

This helps in increasing sales while keeping full control over discounts.

## 🔁 End-to-End Workflow

The complete flow of the system works as follows:

Customer selects oil products →
Places an order →
Chooses payment method →
Admin reviews and confirms the order →
Oil is dispatched →
Order is delivered and completed

Each step is clearly tracked, ensuring transparency for both customer and business.
